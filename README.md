# Introduction to SA Training CAIS
Designing the Introduction to Sentiment Analysis training session at CAIS 

Pre-requisite: I would like it to be open for people without coding experience. This way, it would be good to have everything running on Google collab so participants and just run cells and analyse outputs. 

Proposal: the idea of this training session is to present the basic concepts of **Sentiment Analysis**, focusing especially on its **potentialities** and **limitations** for _research in the humanities_. Some of the topics I'd like to cover are:


## Agenda Monday, 10th July 2023

### Session 1
- Sentiment Analysis
  - What's sentiment analysis
  - How was it developed? 
  - For which purpose? 
  - How does it work computationally?
  - Differences between dictionary-based and contextual-based 
  - How transformers models have changed it? 
- What are the types of SA: 
  - document-level, 
  - aspect-based...
- Exercise: try the following and see sucess and failure:
  - Negation
  - Metaphor
  - Irony/sarcasm
  - Multilinguality
  - Product review vs. Tweet vs. Long text (eg. news)
  - Domain specificity 
- Maybe explainability???

### Session 2

- Case-study: Are news becoming more negative over time? (Based on this experiment I've performed before:https://github.com/caiocmello/news-mood). Here I want to:
  - Show how SA can be used to respond to real world questions;
  - Show how to visualise and analyse sentiment
  - Debate quickly the challenges of working with SA applied to news articles
-
### Session 3

- SA beyond text: analysing sentiment of emojis (By Johannes)
