# Introduction to Sentiment Analysis: Potentials and limitations

Monday, 10th of July 10:00 to 13:00
Place: Center for Advanced Internet Studies (Fully online)

In this workshop, participants will take part in exercises to explore one of the most used Natural Language Processing techniques in the field of Digital Humanities. We are going to cover the history of Sentiment Analysis, how it has changed over time, how it can be applied to research in the humanities & social sciences and more importantly, what its potentials as well as its limitations are.  

The workshop targets especially researchers and students in the Humanities and Social Sciences with special interest in automated text analysis. Knowledge of coding is not a prerequisite. As an introductory course, it will use code but the focus is instead on the critical analysis of the method and its usability. 

Facilitators: 

- Caio Mello
Caio is a Fellow at the Center for Advanced Internet Studies, where he conducts research on sentiment analysis applied to news articles. He is also a PhD candidate at the School of Advanced Study (University of London) in Digital Humanities. 

- Dr. Gaurish Thakkar 
Gaurish Thakkar is a research fellow at the University of Zagreb (Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences), where he works on cross-lingual sentiment analysis for under-resourced languages.

- Dr. Johannes Breuer
Dr. Breuer is a senior researcher in the team Survey Data Augmentation at GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences (Department Survey Data Curation) in Cologne, Germany, and (co-)leads the team Research Data & Methods at the Center for Advanced Internet Studies (CAIS).



## Agenda Monday, 10th July 2023

### Session 1
- Sentiment Analysis
  - What's sentiment analysis
  - How was it developed? 
  - For which purpose? 
  - How does it work computationally?
  - Differences between dictionary-based and contextual-based 
  - How transformers models have changed it? 
- What are the types of SA: 
  - document-level, 
  - aspect-based...
- Exercise: try the following and see sucess and failure:
  - Negation
  - Metaphor
  - Irony/sarcasm
  - Multilinguality
  - Product review vs. Tweet vs. Long text (eg. news)
  - Domain specificity 
- Maybe explainability???

### Session 2

- Case-study: Are news becoming more negative over time? (Based on this experiment I've performed before:https://github.com/caiocmello/news-mood). Here I want to:
  - Show how SA can be used to respond to real world questions;
  - Show how to visualise and analyse sentiment
  - Debate quickly the challenges of working with SA applied to news articles
-
### Session 3

- SA beyond text: analysing sentiment of emojis (By Johannes)
