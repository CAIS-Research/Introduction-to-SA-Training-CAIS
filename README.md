## Introduction to Sentiment Analysis: Potentials and limitations

*Monday, 10th of July 10:00 to 13:00* <br>
*Place: Center for Advanced Internet Studies (Fully online)*

In this workshop, participants will take part in exercises to explore one of the most used Natural Language Processing techniques in the field of Digital Humanities. We are going to cover the history of Sentiment Analysis, how it has changed over time, how it can be applied to research in the humanities & social sciences and more importantly, what its potentials as well as its limitations are.  

The workshop targets especially researchers and students in the Humanities and Social Sciences with special interest in automated text analysis. Knowledge of coding is not a prerequisite. As an introductory course, it will use code but the focus is instead on the critical analysis of the method and its usability.

### Agenda 

#### Session 1
- Sentiment Analysis
  - What's sentiment analysis
  - How was it developed? 
  - For which purpose? 
  - How does it work computationally?
  - Differences between dictionary-based and contextual-based 
  - How transformers models have changed it? 
- What are the types of SA: 
  - document-level, 
  - aspect-based...
- Exercise: try the following and see sucess and failure:
  - Negation
  - Metaphor
  - Irony/sarcasm
  - Multilinguality
  - Product review vs. Tweet vs. Long text (eg. news)
  - Domain specificity 
- Maybe explainability???

#### Session 2

- Case-study: Are news becoming more negative over time? (Based on this experiment I've performed before:https://github.com/caiocmello/news-mood). Here I want to:
  - Show how SA can be used to respond to real world questions;
  - Show how to visualise and analyse sentiment
  - Debate quickly the challenges of working with SA applied to news articles
-
#### Session 3

- [Sentiment analysis beyond text: The curious case of emojis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caiocmello/Introduction-to-SA-Training-CAIS/main/session_3/Emoji_Sentiment.pdf)
  - Emojis
  - Example of sentiment analysis with emojis
  - Limitations and possible next steps
  - Practical: [Sentiment analysis with *ChatGPT*](https://colab.research.google.com/github/caiocmello/Introduction-to-SA-Training-CAIS/blob/main/session_3/Autolabel_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb)
